> A decentralized compute layer for your smart contract enabling secure and
> verifiable computation.

In the traditional context of telecommunications, a switchboard is a human
operated console where connections are manually shuffled around to complete a
circuit and facilitate the flow of information between two or more parties.

Switchboard, the oracle protocol, shares many of the same functions in that a
decentralized quorum of off-chain oracles are responsible for routing data
on-chain in a pre-defined schedule (pushed) or on-demand (pull - async
callbacks). Switchboard's flexibility makes it a general compute layer for your
smart contract allowing you to write your own Switchboard Function, have it
executed off-chain in a secure enclave, then respond on-chain with your own
dynamic logic - no more worrying about servers and kubernetes clusters! With
Switchboard Functions you could build a cross-margin DEX and use a function to
fetch the latest price when settling a user's trade (mitigates oracle
extractable value attacks) and also run some risk engine analysis. Switchboard
Secrets, when paired with Switchboard Functions, give you even more flexibility
and provides an interface to store confidential information and gossip it
between other TEEs.

Switchboard is a compute layer utilizing Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
to provide verifiable computation of your off-chain logic.

## Verifiable Compute

Switchboard provides verifiable computation with the use of Trusted Execution
Environments (TEEs). A TEE is a secure area within a device's hardware or
software that isolates sensitive data and code from the rest of the system.
Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a hardware-based technology that
provides TEE capabilities. It allows developers to create secure enclaves within
the processor where sensitive information can be processed without the risk of
being accessed or modified by unauthorized parties.

## The Oracle Problem

The oracle problem arises due to the inability of blockchains to interact
directly with external systems. Blockchains are isolated networks that only rely
on data stored in their ledger for consensus. The deterministic nature of smart
contracts is a result of the narrow focus of blockchain consensus and their
ability to execute exactly as written with a higher degree of certainty than
traditional systems. Incorrect reporting of external data can lead to
devastating outcomes for on-chain applications dependent on these data feeds.

Below is a high-level overview of the evolution of oracles:

1. **Trusted Signer** [Single Party Trust] - The first iteration of oracles used
   a trusted signer to update a price account on-chain. This model allows a
   single keypair leak to pwn the entire system and should never be considered
   with better options available.
   - Highly vulnerable
2. **Round-Based Consensus** [Multi-Party Trust] - Multiple oracles are polled
   and the final result is determined from the median of the responses.
   - Oracles have no incentives to be honest
3. **Stake-Weighted Consensus** [Incentive Based] - Stake is required to
   participate and oracles lose their stake for acting maliciously. Almost
   there - this system will naturally unbalance as the opportunity cost of
   acting maliciously outweighs the slashing penalty.
   - High infrastructure cost
   - Misalignment of incentives when TVL attack exceeds slashing penalty

### Our Solution

Switchboard addresses the oracle problem by combining:

1. **Verifiable Execution** - Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are
   leveraged to enforce that off-chain oracles are operated within a secure
   enclave. TEEs provide cryptographic proof that the code being executed wasn't
   tampered with and provides a way to enforce a set of protocol rules. Code is
   law.
2. **Economic Incentives** - Oracles must have a minimum stake to join the
   network and get rewarded for honest reporting. Oracles who fail to respond or
   respond incorrectly will be slashed and lose part of their stake to
   incentivize honest behavior.
3. **Independent Queues** - Oracles join a set queue which defines the security
   settings of its compute network. The queue authority could be controlled by a
   DAO creating an autonomous compute network governed by its participants. The
   queue controls the reward and slashing behavior to entice new oracles to join
   the network during congestion.
4. **Permissionless / Customization** - Developers can worry about coding and
   leave the execution to the Switchboard oracle network. Write the code and let
   Switchboard do the rest. Switchboard consumers can opt-out and create their
   own queue to execute their own custom code.

## Is SGX Secure?

Intel's SGX has had vulnerabilities in the past but its use in secure
communications and credit card privacy show its not going anywhere. Switchboard
mitigates active vulnerabilities by requiring oracles to verify their quote once
a week, allowing the protocol to enforce patches and upgrades for vulnerability
reports. Think of Switchboard as the management layer for managing Attestation
quotes.

Switchboard also relies on economic incentives like staking and slashing to
persuade honest behavior from participants. Economic incentives paired with TEEs
provides a high level of security for smart contracts to rely on for off-chain
computation.

**What about Secret Network?**

Secret Network is a privacy, layer 1 blockchain that uses secure enclaves for
encrypting transactions.
[Researchers were able to exploit a vulnerability in SGX](https://blockworks.co/news/secret-network-crypto-transactions-not-so-secret-after-all)
to leak the consensus seed and decrypt all past transactions.
[The fatal mistake was not rotating the decryption key](https://twitter.com/tom_yurek/status/1597660344876699648)
to prevent machines running with known vulnerabilities from attesting their
quote. Switchboard mitigates this by requiring weekly verification of oracles
quotes to prevent a past vulnerability from affecting future performance.
