Switchboard Functions allow you to verifiably execute your own Rust code
off-chain and submit transactions either on a pre-defined cron schedule or
on-demand. Switchboard Functions gives smart contracts greater flexibility as
they can delegate execution to an off-chain computational layer.

## Switchboard Functions Overview

The Attestation Program contains a set of verifier oracles which watch the chain
for attestation requests. When a request is found the verifier oracles will
execute your container within a secure enclave. The container contains your
custom off-chain logic and needs to return a list of instructions along with a
quote generated from within the enclave. The verifier oracles will attest, or
"verify", that the code running within the enclave matches the expected enclave
values you control.

The very first instruction returned by your function should be the Switchboard
**_functionVerify_** instruction. This instruction is signed by the verifier
oracle which is also run within an enclave and has its verifier codebase
attested on-chain. If we can prove the keypair never left the enclave and the
keypair signed the transaction, then we can be sure that the code was executed
securely.

Below are the current parameters set for the Switchboard Labs Attestation Queue:

| Param                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Minimum Update Interval     | **_1 second!_** <br /><br />The minimum time between requesting a function update. You can set a cron schedule of `1 * * * * *` to request an update every second!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Cost                        | **20_000 Lamports (0.00002 SOL)**<br /><br />The amount of lamports that is charged for each `function_verify` call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Maximum Instruction(s) Size | **548 Bytes (667 Bytes soon)** <br /><br />The maximum size of instruction(s) you can return including all extra signers. The `function_verify` ixn currently uses 684 Bytes. Address lookup tables will be supported allowing you to fit more accounts per transaction; this will free ~100 bytes giving you 667 bytes for your custom instructions. <br /><br /> Transaction bundles will be supported when a common standard is agreed upon at the protocol level; this will allow you to return an arbitrary number of instructions which get executed in-order and rolled back if any instruction fails. |
