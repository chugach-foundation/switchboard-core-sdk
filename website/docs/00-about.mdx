# Switchboard

> A decentralized, serverless compute layer for your smart contract enabling
> secure and verifiable computation.

In the traditional context of telecommunications, a switchboard was a
human-operated console where connections were manually shuffled around to
complete a circuit and facilitate the flow of information between two or more
parties. Switchboard, the oracle protocol, shares many of the same functions in
that a decentralized quorum of oracles are responsible for how data is shuffled
around a blockchain for smart contract devs to consume and build-upon.
Switchboard is a general purpose compute layer allowing you to build serverless
functions and delegate the off-chain compute and verification to our network of
oracles.

## Verifiable Compute

Switchboard provides verifiable computation with the use of Trusted Execution
Environments (TEEs). A TEE is a secure area within a device's hardware or
software that isolates sensitive data and code from the rest of the system.
Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a hardware-based technology that
provides TEE capabilities. Switchboard leverages SGX to run a user's custom code
within its own SGX runtime and provides the attestation service to verify
on-chain that the quote generated from the executed code matches the expected
measurement set by the user on-chain with their `MRENCLAVE` value.

See the [What are TEEs?](/tee) page for more information.

## Data Models

1. **Scheduled** [_"pushed"_] - Write your own logic to push data on-chain on a
   pre-defined schedule. _(e.g. A trading platform could use a single
   Switchboard Function to route 500+ data feeds. See the PushOracle EVM
   contract to see this in action!)_
2. **Off-Chain Store** [_"pull"_] - Client-side applications pull data on-chain
   when needed and use merkle trees to verify the integrity of the data.
3. **On-Demand** ["callback"] - Perform async operations with your contract by
   using a callback to settle some user initiated action after executing your
   own custom logic. _(e.g. A lending protocol could require a function to open
   new positions and prevent flash loans)_

Switchboard's flexibility makes it a general compute layer for your smart
contract allowing you to write your own custom logic via a Switchboard Function,
have it executed off-chain within a secure enclave, then respond on-chain with
your own dynamic logic - no more worrying about servers and kubernetes clusters!
