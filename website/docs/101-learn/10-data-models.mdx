# The Data Models

The following sections depict the different ways of data propagation provided by 
oracles and how developers can integrate Switchboard to have full control over 
how data is sourced on-chain for their smart contracts.

## Push

Data is _**pushed**_ on-chain by the oracle at a routine interval. The integrator 
just needs to verify the data was recently pushed and doesn't need to handle any 
off-chain requesting.

Switchboard Functions allow you to set up functions on a cron schedule, which 
essentially performs the same as a push based oracle. See [Switchboard Functions](/functions) 
for more information.

## Pull (Not supported)

Data is fetched and maintained in a data store (different from the origin chain) 
and _**pulled**_ on-chain by the integrator through a bridge.

## Callback

Data is sourced off-chain each time it is requested and populated on-chain with
a callback into the callers smart contract. This method is more complex to
integrate but is less susceptible to oracle attacks because the data is only
sourced when the user requests it.

Switchboard Functions allow you to set up functions on a callback model, which 
allows you to trigger based on events and pass in parameters. See [Switchboard Functions](/functions) 
for more information.

## Comparison

Each type of data propagation method poses their own advantages. The following 
table compares the different criteria that should be looked at when 
deciding which method is best for your specific solution.
