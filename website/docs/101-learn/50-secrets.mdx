There is some information, of course which you do not want to make publicly
visible on chain or inside your docker container. What if you want to fetch
Uniswap liquidity information but don't want to expose your Infura API key in
your container? For this, you can use Switchboard Secrets.

Repo: https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/secrets-server

By hosting a Switchboard Secrets server, you can keep your secret keys on a
private server and ensure the secrets will only be passed to your function
if it proves its running inside an enclave and is running the code you're
allowing to view the secrets!

:::note

**Switchboard is creating a first party service to manage secret servers
for you. COming Soon!**
