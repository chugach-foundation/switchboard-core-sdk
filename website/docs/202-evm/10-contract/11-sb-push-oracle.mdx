title: Sb Push Oracle
---

The Sb Push Oracle is an example of using a single Switchboard Function to fetch
and push 500+ prices from a centralized exchange on-chain. Like the Switchboard
contract, it also implements
[EIP-2535 Diamond Proxy Pattern](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2535.md)
to support customizing for your needs.

## Diamond Facets

The Sb Push Oracle contract implements the following facets:

- [Admin](#admin)
- [Receiver](#receiver)

### Admin

The admin module is responsible for program based authoritative actions such as
program upgrades and setting which function is allowed to send new updates to
this receiver.

### Receiver

The Push Receiver contract is responsible for the actual storage of the updated
values given some threshold of variance for each price point.
