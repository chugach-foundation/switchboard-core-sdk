### Oracle Account(s)

Oracle Accounts represent an off-chain node which watch the chain for events and respond to aggregator and VRF update requests.

#### Permission Account

An Oracle Account is required to have a Permission Account initialized and be granted `PERMIT_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT` permissions from the queue authority. Oracles are always required to be granted these permissions to prevent malicous nodes from joining.

### Aggregator Account(s)

Aggregator Accounts (or **data feeds**) represent a collection of job accounts instruction the oracle on how to fetch data off-chain as well as a configuration dictating how often updates may be requested.

#### Job Account(s)

Job Accounts represent a single data source and instruct the oracle on how to fetch data off-chain.

#### Lease Account

A lease account is a pre-funded escrow to reward Oracle Accounts for updating an aggregator.
